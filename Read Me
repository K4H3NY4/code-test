Tasks:
Task 1
 Write an application that accepts two parameters as input; a sentence and its desired length.
 If the length of the sentence is equal to or less than the desired length, the application should
output the input sentence if full.
 If the length of the sentence is greater than the desired length, truncate the sentence to the
required length and output the outcome.
 All characters in the sentence must be full words, no half words should be output from the
application.
 The last character in the sentence should not be a ‘whitespace’ character.


Task 2
 Write an application that accepts two input parameters string1 and string2.
 If String 1 and String2 are similar, the application should output (String1(value)=String2(value))
eg (sample=sample) and exit.
 If String1 can be obtained from String2 by moving one letter to the left or right, the application
should output (move letter x to the left) eg (input String1 = Center, String2 = Centre, application
should output move r to the right).
 If String1 cannot be obtained from String2 by making a simple left or right manipulation, the
application should output impossible.


Task 3
 Write an application that takes an integer array as input and returns the smallest value missing
from the array.
 The application should be able to do input validation and ensure only integer array is passed as
input.
 The application should output smallest missing integer from the array, eg input being {1,2,5,6}
output should be 3 missing.
